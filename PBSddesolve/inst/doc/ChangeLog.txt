-------------------------

1.12.6 (2019-12-09) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * C code
    + Kurt Hornik noted: PBSddesolve_1.12.5.tar.gz still seems to fail to install with gcc10.
      - Added -fno-common in various lines of Rdev's Makeconf files to check for duplicate declarations
      -  (as per R-extensions: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Common-symbols)
      - CFLAGS = -O2 -Wall $(DEBUGFLAG) -std=gnu99 -mtune=generic -fno-common
      - CXX11FLAGS = -O2 -Wall $(DEBUGFLAG) -mtune=generic -fno-common
      - CXX14FLAGS = -O2 -Wall $(DEBUGFLAG) -mtune=generic -fno-common
      - Rdevcheck fails when lines `globaldatatype global_data; globalRdatatype r_stuff;' appear in both `PBSddesolve.c' and `R-model.c'.
      - Removed the declaration in 'r_model.c' and the check works OK, the build works OK, and the examples work.
      - ACB approves changes.

1.12.5 (2019-12-06) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * C code
    + Prof. Ripley noted `PBSddesolve fails to install with gcc trunk which is due to be released as gcc 10.0.x early in 2020.
    + PBSddesolve.log shows:
      - ddesolve95.h:38: multiple definition of `r_stuff'; ddesolve95.h:38: first defined here
      - ddesolve95.h:37: multiple definition of `global_data'; ddesolve95.h:37: first defined here
    + ACB suggested:
      - change ddesolve95.h:38 to `extern globalRdatatype r_stuff;'
      - then define the global in a c file as: `globalRdatatype r_stuff;'
      - Same would apply to global_data. For some reason it looks like each time the header is included,
      -  it's creating new memory for the structures in each c file since the extern keyword is missing.
    + Altered `ddesolve95.h' (RH 191204)
      - changed `globaldatatype global_data;' to `extern globaldatatype global_data;'
      - changed `globalRdatatype r_stuff;'    to `extern globalRdatatype r_stuff;'
    + Altered `PBSddesolve.c' (RH 191204)
      - added `/* define globals */  globaldatatype global_data;  globalRdatatype r_stuff;'
    + Altered `r_model.c' (RH 191204)
      - added `/* define globals */  globaldatatype global_data;  globalRdatatype r_stuff;'

1.12.4 (2019-03-11) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * C code
    + Altered calls to PROTECT in `PBSddesolve.c' and `r_model.c. (RH 2019-03-11)
      - C function `startDDE' needed an additional UNPROTECT for the PROTECT_WITH_INDEX
      - Similar to the additional UNPROTECT found in C function `do_lapply' in `apply.c' of R-dev's src/main.
    + Stack imbalances generated (2019-03-11)
      - blowflies:
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '<-', 71 then 72
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '{', 67 then 68
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '{', 53 then 54
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in 'withVisible', 35 then 36
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in 'standardGeneric', 26 then 27
      - cooling:
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '<-', 29 then 30
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '{', 25 then 26
      - icecream:
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '<-', 71 then 72
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '<-', 72 then 73
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '{', 67 then 69
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '{', 53 then 55
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in 'withVisible', 35 then 37
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in 'standardGeneric', 26 then 28
      - lorenz:
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '<-', 29 then 30
      -  Warning: stack imbalance in '{', 25 then 26

1.12.3 (2019-03-07) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * C code
    + Registered C routines using `init.c' from PBSmodelling|PBSmapping as a template. (RH 190305)
      - Renamed `PBSddesolve.h ' to `ddesolve95.h'
      - Created new header file `PBSddesolve.h' for use with `init.c'
    + Attempted to fix CRAN issues in `r_model.c' and `PBSddesolve.c'. (RH 190306)
      - Function grad
      -  [UP] unprotected variable yinit_names while calling allocating function Rf_allocVector PBSddesolve/src/r_model.c:140
      - Function startDDE
      -  [UP] unprotected variable yinit_names while calling allocating function Rf_mkChar PBSddesolve/src/PBSddesolve.c:374
      -  [UP] unprotected variable yinit_names while calling allocating function Rf_mkChar PBSddesolve/src/PBSddesolve.c:379
      -  [UP] unprotected variable list while calling allocating function freeglobaldata PBSddesolve/src/PBSddesolve.c:440
      - Function testFunc
      -  [UP] unprotected variable yinit_names while calling allocating function Rf_allocVector PBSddesolve/src/PBSddesolve.c:186
  * Documentation
    + Updated the vignette `PBSddesolveIntro.Rnw|pdf'. (RH 190306)

1.12.2 (2016-09-20)
  * Documentation
    + Changed backticks ` in DESCRIPTION to single quotes ' (Kurt Hornik 2016-09-20)
  * C code
    + You need to set the BINPREF variable in etc/.../Makeconf and you can omit the ? (Uwe Ligges 2016-04-18)
      - Old: BINPREF ?= c:/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/
      - New: BINPREF = C:/Apps/R/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/
  * R code
    + Fixed bug in `run_tests.r' but tests of `all(out$y1==yinit)' in `test.simple' (runit.dde.r) return FALSE -- problem in `dde'? (RH 160914)
    + Renamed directory `tests' to `unitTests' (as done by PBSmodelling) to avoid testing by Duncan Murdoch's changes to `R CMD check' and `testInstalledPackage()' (RH 1609014)

1.12.1 (2016-04-18)
  * Documentation
    + Updated the User's Guide. (RH 160418)
    + Revised the vignette `PBSddesolveIntro.Rnw' and DESCRIPTION file. (RH 160414).

1.12.0 2015-08-19 (JTS)
  * Documentation
    + First semantic version number x.y.z

1.11  2015-06-15
  * Documentation
    + Last update to Google Code before transferring pbs-ddesolve repository to GitHub. (RH 150615)
  * R code
    + Changed `yout1$t' to `yout1$time' and `yout2$t' to `yout2$time' in `icePlot' to eliminate partial matching warnings. (RH 140514)
      - Also changed `x$t' to `x$time' in blowflies example `runPlot'; disallowed A0<=0 by setting to GT0(A0) if needed.
    + Fixed overflow of `otimes' within dde(...). (NB 140509)
      - valgrind identified an invalid read within dde(...): the array `otimes' was being overflowed by one element. 
      - This commit fixes that overflow and another potential problem that would occur if `otimes' ever had a length of 0, 
      - which is a possibility mentioned in the function startDDE(...) of PBSddesolve.c.
    + Removed deprecated partial matching in example code. (NB 140509)
      - The example code used partial matching when accessing the data frame, i.e., yout$t to access "time".
      - This feature has been deprecated and now produces a warning.
  * Administration
    + JTS requested that RH becomes the package Maintainer. (RH 140327)
    + Bumped up version for next posting to CRAN using builds under R-3.0.3 (RH 140320)

1.10  2013-05-03
  * Documentation
    + Updated `PBSddesolve-UG.pdf` to reflect new Lorenz GUI and updated web links. (RH 130503)
    + Updated `PBSddesolveIntro` Rnw and pdf to alert the reader that examples run in new environment called `.PBSddeEnv`. (RH 130502)
  *R code
    + Introduced new temporary working environment `.PBSddeEnv` in which examples can be run. (RH 130502)
    + Fix "start time" bug introduced in r19 ( issue 4 ) (NB 130502)
      - In r19, a line that initialized t to t0 was cut.  This update restores that line and addresses  issue 4 .
      - This update also renames an identifier so that it now differs from the R "error" function.
  * Administration
    + Moved `PBSddesolveIntro.Rnw` to `vignettes` directory. (RH 130425)
    + Advanced version for resubmission to CRAN and to avoid some nonsense message during Rcheck:
      - `Version contains leading zeroes (1.09)` (RH 130425)

1.09  2013-04-25
  * C code
    + Fixed compilation issue on Windows along with two compiler warnings. (NB 130425)
    + Moved banner message to `.onAttach` and fixed warnings. (NB 130323)
    + Removed `info` (unused) and `PBSerror`, and added calls to `error`. (NB 121205)
    + Changed an 'exit' to a 'return' in 'PBSddesolve.c'. (RH 121101)
  * Administration
    + JTS changed email address to schnutej-dfo@shaw.ca (RH 121031)
    + R-2.14.0 requires namespace and loading via '.onLoad'. (RH 121110)

1.08  2010-11-07  ACB
  * C code
    + Merged in Bobby's memory clean up modifications. (ACB 101107)
    + Added check to delete global memory when startDDE is interrupted by the user,
      - memory is only cleared on subsequent calls to startDDE (or clean exits). (ACB 101104)
    + Removed dummy_var nonsense, and re-factored to simply pass a NULL rather than have a static pointer malloced 
      - (which caused a potential buffer overflow on subsequent calls with larger number of variables to solve). (ACB 101104)
    + Fixed memory leak; fixes Issue 3. (ACB 101003)
    + Moved old ddesolve to branches. (ACB 100927)
    + Added 'freeglobaldata()' to PBSddesolve.c to fix memory leak. (ACB 100827)
    + Included the short deprecated version of ddesolve. (ACB 100623)
    + Added a minor comment to PBSddesolve.c. Changed version to 1.08. (ACB 100420)
